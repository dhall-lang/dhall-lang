Returns `1` if the `Optional` value is present and `0` if the value is absent

Examples:

```
./length Natural (Some 2) = 1

./length Natural (None Natural) = 0
```
-}
    let length
        : ∀(a : Type) → Optional a → Natural
        =   λ(a : Type)
          → λ(xs : Optional a)
          → Optional/fold a xs Natural (λ(_ : a) → 1) 0
