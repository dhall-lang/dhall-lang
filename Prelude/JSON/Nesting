{-
This type is used as part of `dhall-json`'s support for preserving alternative
names

For example, this Dhall code:

```
    let Example = < Left : { foo : Natural } | Right : { bar : Bool } >

in  let example = constructors Example

in  let Nesting = < Inline : {} | Nested : Text >

in  let nesting = constructors Nesting

in  { field    = "name"
    , nesting  = nesting.Inline {=}
    , contents = example.Left { foo = 2 }
    }
```

... generates this JSON:

```
{
  "foo": 2,
  "name": "Left"
 }
```

-}
let Nesting : Type = < Inline : {} | Nested : Text > in Nesting
