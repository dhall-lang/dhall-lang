# Changelog

All notable changes the Dhall language standard will be documented in this file.

For more info about our versioning policy, see [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

## `v1.0.0`

Here we start versioning the language standard on its own.

Previously it was versioned together with the [reference implementation][dhall-haskell],
so see [here][dhall-haskell-changelog] for information on previous breaking changes
to the language.
