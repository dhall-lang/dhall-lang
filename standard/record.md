# Record syntactic sugar

There are three desugaring steps applied to records as they parsed, before they
are further interpreted:

* First, a field without rhs like `{ x }` desugars to `{ x = x }`
* Second, dotted syntax like `{ x.y = a }` desugars to `{ x = { y = a } }`
* Third, duplicate fields like `{ x = a, x = b }` desugar to `{ x = a ∧ b }`

The following example illustrates how the two latter features interact:

```dhall
{ x.y = a, x.z = b }
```

The above expression first desugars to:

```dhall
{ x = { y = a }, x = { z = b } }
```

... which then further desugars to:

```dhall
{ x = { y = a } ∧ { z = b } }
```

... which eventually β-normalizes to:

```dhall
{ x = { y = a, z = b } }
```

Additionally, the language supports syntax for updating a field nested within a
record using the `with` keyword, like this:

```dhall
record with x.y.z = a
```

... which desugars to:

```dhall
record // { x = record.x // { y = record.x.y // { z = a } } }
```

## Record puns

When assigning a variable to a field of the same name, Dhall allows eliding the repetition. For example:

```dhall
{ x = x }
```

can equivalently be written like this:

```dhall
{ x }
```

The above translation is governed by the following judgment which converts
a record containing record puns to a record without record puns:

    desugar-puns(r₀) = r₁

... where:

* `r₀` (the input) is a record literal potentially containing record puns
* `r₁` (the output) is a record literal free of record puns

The rules for the translation are:

    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────  ; Base case for an
    desugar-puns({=}) = {=}                                  ; empty record


    desugar-puns({ ys₀… }) = { ys₁… }
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────  ; Normal fields are
    desugar-puns({ x = e, ys₀… }) = { x = e, ys₁… }  ; left untouched


    desugar-puns({ ys₀… }) = { ys₁… }
    ───────────────────────────────────────────  ; Record puns are
    desugar-puns({ x, ys₀… }) = { x = x, ys₁… }  ; desugared


For all other cases, `desugar-puns` descends into sub-expressions and ignores
anything that is not a record literal.


## Dotted syntax

Dhall records permit dot-separated field labels to specify nested records, like
this:

```dhall
{ x.y.z = a }
```

Dot-separated fields like the above desugar to nested records.  For example,
the above Dhall expression desugars to:

```dhall
{ x = { y = { z = a } } }
```

The above translation is governed by the following judgment which converts
a record containing dot-separated fields to a record without dot-separated
fields:

    desugar-dotted-fields(r₀) = r₁

... where:

* `r₀` (the input) is a record literal potentially containing dot-separated
  fields
* `r₁` (the output) is a record literal free of dot-separated fields

The rules for the translation are:

    desugar-dotted-fields({ xs… = { x = e }, ys… }) = r   ; Induction: More than
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────  ; one dot-separated
    desugar-dotted-fields({ xs….x = e, ys… }) = r         ; field


    desugar-dotted-fields({ ys₀… }) = { ys₁… }                ; Base case for
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  ; no more
    desugar-dotted-fields({ x = e, ys₀… }) = { x = e, ys₁… }  ; remaining dots


    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────  ; Base case for an
    desugar-dotted-fields({=}) = {=}                         ; empty record

For all other cases, `desugar-dotted-fields` descends into sub-expressions and ignores
anything that is not a record literal.


## Duplicate fields

Dhall records permit duplicate record fields, like this:

```dhall
{ x = { y = 1 }, x = { z = 1 } }
```

Duplicate record fields like the above desugar to the use of the `∧` operator
to merge those duplicate occurrences.  For example, the above Dhall
expression desugars to:

```dhall
{ x = { y = 1 } ∧ { z = 1 } }
```

... which in turn β-normalizes to:

```dhall
{ x = { y = 1, z = 1 } }
```

Desugaring to the `∧` operator ensures that duplicate fields may not collide.
For example, these expression are all ill-typed:

```dhall
-- Desugars to { x = 0 ∧ 0 } which is ill-typed
{ x = 0, x = 0 }

-- Desugars to { x = 0 ∧ { y = 1 } } which is ill-typed
{ x = 0, x = { y = 1 } }

-- Desugars to { x = { y = 1 } ∧ { y = 1 } } which is ill-typed
{ x = { y = 1 }, x = { y = 1 } }
```

This desugaring behavior is governed by the following judgment that translates
duplicate field occurrences to the `∧` operator:

    desugar-duplicates(r₀) = r₁

... where:

* `r₀` (the input) is a record literal potentially containing duplicate fields
* `r₁` (the output) is a record literal free of duplicate fields

The desugaring behavior operates as follows:


    desugar-duplicates({ x = v₀ ∧ v₁, xs₀… }) = r
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────  ; Inductive case for when
    desugar-duplicates({ x = v₀, x = v₁, xs₀… }) = r  ; duplicates are present


    desugar-duplicates({ xs₀… }) = { xs₁… }                ; Base case for when
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────  ; `x` has no more
    desugar-duplicates({ x = v, xs₀… }) = { x = v, xs₁… }  ; duplicates left


    ─────────────────────────────  ; Base case for when the record has no more
    desugar-duplicates({=}) = {=}  ; keys left


Take care to combine duplicate keys in the correct order and the correct
associativity.  For example, the following expression:

```dhall
  λ(a : { x : Natural })
→ λ(b : { y : Natural })
→ λ(c : { z : Natural })
→ { k = a, k = b, k = c }
```

... should desugar to this:

```dhall
  λ(a : { x : Natural })
→ λ(b : { y : Natural })
→ λ(c : { z : Natural })
→ { k = (a ∧ b) ∧ c }
{-  Note that the parentheses are not necessary since all operators are
    left-associative, but they are included for clarity
-}
```

## `with` keyword

You can use the `with` keyword for ergonomic updates to deeply-nested records,
like this:

```dhall
let record = { a.b = { c = 1, d = True } }

in  record with a.b.d = False with a.b.e = 2.0
```

... which evaluates to:

```dhall
{ a.b = { c = 1, d = False, e = 2.0 } }
```

This following judgment that translates the `with` keyword to the `//` operator:

    desugar-with(e₀ with ks = v) = e₁

... where:

* `e₀` (an input) is an expression representing a record to update
* `ks` (an input) is one or more dot-separated record labels representing the
  record path to the value to insert
* `v`  (an input) is the value to insert
* `e₁` (the output) is the desugared expression

However, this judgment is not used to desugar the expression at parsing time.
Rather, the expression is desugared "just in time" as part of type-checking and
β-normalization, so that implementations can have greater freedom to
optimize the implementation of this expression.

A `with` expression with multiple dotted labels is equivalent to chained uses of
the `//` operator:


    desugar-with(e₀ // { k₀ = e₀.k₀ with k₁.ks… = v₁ }) = e₁
    ─────────────────────────────────────────  ; Inductive case for more than one
    desugar-with(e₀ with k₀.k₁.ks… = v₀) = e₁  ; label


... and if there is only one update with one label then the `with` keyword is a
synonym for the `//` operator:


    desugar-with(e₀ // { k = v }) = e₁
    ──────────────────────────────────  ; Base case for exactly one
    desugar-with(e₀ with k = v) = e₁    ; label


For all other cases, `desugar-with` descends into sub-expressions and ignores
anything that is not a `with` expression.

An implementation may desugar `with` in a more efficient way.  For example,
the following implementation of `desugar-with` may be more efficient for
chained `with` expressions:

    ↑(1, _, 0, v₁) = v₂
    desugar-with(let _ = e₀ in _ // { k₀ = _.k₀ with k₁.ks… = v₂ }) = e₁
    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  ; Inductive case for more than one label
    desugar-with(e₀ with k₀.k₁.ks… = v₀) = e₁
