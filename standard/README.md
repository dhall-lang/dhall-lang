# Semantics

This document formalizes the semantics for resolving, type-checking and
normalizing Dhall expressions.

Note that this document *does not* specify how a language binding marshals an
normalized Dhall expression into a matching expression in the host language.
The details of how to do so are left open to each implementation, including
supported integer ranges or how to idiomatically encode unions.

## Summary

Dhall's type system is a variation on [CCω][ccw], implemented using a pure type
system (see the ["Function check"](#function-check) section for more details).
Type abstraction and type application are explicit and not inferred.  Dhall also
supports additional built-in functions, operators, and constants for efficiency.

Dhall also supports referencing shadowed variables through the use of DeBruijn
indices.  This document spells out in detail how to implement these
DeBruijn-like variable references.

## Expressions

The syntax of allowed Dhall expressions is specified in
[`./dhall.abnf`](./dhall.abnf).
The following notation is a simplified version of the syntax found in
`./dhall.abnf`.  This simplified notation is used for all of the following
judgments:

```
m, n = 0 / 1 + n  ; Natural numbers

d = ±n            ; Integers

x, y              ; Variables

; Mnemonics for the most commonly used labels:
;
; Terms are lowercase:
;
;     a    = input term whose type is "A"
;     b    = output term whose type is "B"
;     f    = "f"unction
;     l, r = "l"eft and "r"ight term that share the same type
;     e    = term whose type is "E"
;     t    = term whose type is "T"
;     u    = term whose type is "U"
;
; Types are uppercase:
;
;     A  = type of the input term "a"
;     B  = type of the output term "b"
;     E  = type of the term "e"
;     T  = type of the term "t"
;     U  = type of the term "u"
;
; Constants that are `Type`, `Kind`, or `Sort` are lowercase:
;
;     c = "c"onstant
;     i = function's "i"nput type
;     o = function's "o"utput type
;
; Similar terms are distinguished by subscripts like `a₀`, `a₁`, …
;
; A term that represents zero or more values or key-value pairs ends with `s…`,
; such as `as…`
;
; Note that these are only informal mnemonics.  Dhall is a pure type system,
; which means that many places in the syntax permit terms, types, kinds, and
; sorts. The typing judgments are the authoritative rules for what expressions
, are permitted and forbidden.

```

## Notation for induction

This document uses a non-standard `…` notation for distinguishing list elements
or key-value pairs in records/unions from other expression types,
records, and unions:

```
t          : Naked label which could be any type of expression.

[ ts…  ]   : A list with 0 or more values.
[ t, ts… ] : A list with 1 or more values.  The first value is `t`.

{ xs… }        : A record type or record value with 0 or more fields.
{ x : T, xs… } : A record type with 1 or more field-type pairs.  At least one
                 field is named `x` with a type of `T`.
{ x = t, xs… } : A record value with 1 or more field-value pairs.  At least one
                 field is named `x` with a value of `t`.

< xs… >                    : A union type with 0 or more alternative-type pairs.
< x : T | xs… >            : A union type with 1 or more alternative-type pairs.
                             At least one alternative is named `x` with a type
                             of `T`.
< x | xs… >                : A union type with 1 or more empty alternatives
                             At least one alternative is named `x`, which is an
                             empty alternative

"s"           : A `Text` literal without any interpolated expressions
"s${t}ss…"    : A `Text` literal with at least one interpolated expression

''
s''           : A multi-line `Text` literal with only one line

''
ss
s''           : A multi-ine `Text` literal with more than one line
```

You will see this notation in judgments that perform induction on lists,
records, or unions.  For example, the following judgment for normalizing a
non-empty list says that to normalize a list you normalize the head of the list
and then normalize the tail:


    t₀ ⇥ t₁   [ ts₀… ] ⇥ [ ts₁… ]
    ─────────────────────────────
    [ t₀, ts₀… ] ⇥ [ t₁, ts₁… ]


Note that this notation does not imply that implementations must use induction
or inductive data structures (like linked lists) to implement lists, records, or
unions.  Implementations may freely use more efficient data structures like
arrays or dictionaries, so long as they behave the same.

## Record keys

We use the `keys` operator to define rules based on the keys of record types or
literals, for example:

    keys({ x : Bool, y : Natural }) = x, y

    keys({=}) = ε

where `ε` represents an empty sequence.

More formally, we define


    s ⇥ {}
    ───────────
    keys(s) = ε


    s ⇥ { x : T, ss… }
    keys(ss…) = ss₁…
    ──────────────────
    keys(s) = x, ss₁…


for record types and analogously for record literals.

## Multi-line string literals

Dhall's grammar supports multi-line string literals, such as:

    ''
    foo
    bar
    ''

These multi-line string literals are syntactic sugar for ordinary double-quoted
string literals and the conversion from multi-line string literals double-quoted
string literals occurs at parse time.

For example, the above multi-line string literal is parsed as:

    "foo\nbar\n"

Because this conversion occurs at parse-time all of the following judgments
only deal with double-quoted string literals.  Consequently, there are no
separate rules for type-checking or normalizing multi-line string literals.

The logic for desugaring multi-line string literals to
double-quoted string literals is implemented in a judgment:

    to-double-quotes(s₀) = s₁

You can find the details of this judgment in the following separate document:

* [Multi-line literal semantics](./multiline.md)

## Record syntactic sugar

Dhall supports syntactic sugar for records that also occurs at parse time.

For example, a record literal of the form:

    { x.y = 1, x.z = 1 } }

... first desugars dotted fields to nested records:

    { x = { y = 1 }, x = { z = 1 } }

... and then desugars duplicate fields by merging them using `∧`:

    { x = { y = 1 } ∧ { z = 1} }

Because this conversion occurs at parse-time all of the following judgments
only deal with records that have no dotted fields and that have unique keys.

Desugaring record literals with dotted fields is implemented by the following
judgment:

    desugar-dotted-fields(r₀) = r₁

... and desugaring record literals with duplicate fields is handled by the
following judgment:

    desugar-duplicates(r₀) = r₁

You can find the details of these judgments in the following separate document:

* [Record syntactic sugar](./record.md)

## Shift

Dhall allows variables to reference shadowed variables of the same name using De
Bruijn indices.  For example:


                                  ┌──refers to──┐
                                  │             │
                                  ↓             │
    λ(x : Type) → λ(y : Type) → λ(x : Type) → x@0


      ┌────────────────refers to────────────────┐
      │                                         │
      ↓                                         │
    λ(x : Type) → λ(y : Type) → λ(x : Type) → x@1


`x@n` refers to the "nth" bound variable named `x` counting outwards from where
the variable is referenced.

If a variable does not specify the De Bruijn index (i.e. just `x`) then the De
Bruijn index defaults to 0 (i.e. `x@0`), like this:


                                  ┌─refers to─┐
                                  │           │
                                  ↓           │
    λ(x : Type) → λ(y : Type) → λ(x : Type) → x


Dhall uses a shift function internally to avoid variable capture in the
implementation of De Bruijn indices.

This shift function has the form:

    ↑(d, x, m, e₀) = e₁

You can find the details of this judgment in the following separate document:

* [Shift](./shift.md)


## Contexts

The syntax of contexts is:

    Γ = ε         ; The empty context
      / Γ, x : T  ; A context extended with a type annotation for a variable

Contexts are ordered and there can be multiple type annotations in the context
for the same variable.  The DeBruijn index associated with each variable
disambiguates which variable to refer to in the context.

## Shift context

You can also shift a context by shifting each expression in that context:


    ─────────────────
    ↑(d, x, m, ε) = ε


    ↑(d, x, m, Γ₀) = Γ₁   ↑(d, x, m, T₀) = T₁
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
    ↑(d, x, m, (Γ₀, y : T₀)) = Γ₁, y : T₁


## Substitution

β-reduction requires support for substitution, which consists in replacing
the uses of a given variable in an expression by another expression.

Substitution has the form:

    e₀[x@n ≔ a] = e₁

You can find the details of this judgment in the following separate document:

* [Substitution](./substitution.md)


## α-normalization

α-normalization renames all bound variables within an expression to use De
Bruijn indices.

α-normalization has the form:

    t₀ ↦ t₁

You can find the details of this judgment in the following separate document:

* [α-normalization](./alpha-normalization.md)


## β-normalization

β-normalization transforms a Dhall expression to an expression called its
normal form. This is similar to "executing" the program represented by the
given Dhall expression.

β-normalization has the form:

    t₀ ⇥ t₁

You can find the details of this judgment in the following separate document:

* [β-normalization](./beta-normalization.md)


## Equivalence

Equivalence captures what it means for two Dhall expressions to be "the same".
It is used for type inference and β-normalization.

Equivalence is a relationship between two expression of the form:


    l ≡ r


Two expressions are equivalent if they are identical after β-normalization,
α-normalization, and binary encoding:


    l₀ ⇥ l₁   l₁ ↦ x   encode(x) = b   r₀ ⇥ r₁   r₁ ↦ y   encode(y) = b
    ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    l₀ ≡ r₀


Note that this definition of equivalence does not include η-equivalence, so
`λ(f : Bool → Bool) → λ(x : Bool) → f x` and `λ(f : Bool → Bool) → f` are not
equivalent.

Note also that this means that `Double`s should not be compared using standard float equality.

## Function check

The function check governs the types of functions that our pure type system
permits.

The function check is a judgment of the form:

    c₀ ↝ c₁ : c₂

You can find the details of this judgment in the following separate document:

* [Function check](./function-check.md)


## Type inference

Type inference is a judgment of the form:

    Γ ⊢ t : T

You can find the details of this judgment in the following separate document:

* [Type inference](./type-inference.md)


## Binary encoding and decoding

Dhall supports encoding and decoding expressions to and from a binary format.

Binary encoding and decoding is captured by two judgments:

    encode(dhall) = cbor
    decode(cbor) = dhall

You can find the details of these judgments in the following separate document:

* [Binary semantics](./binary.md)


## Import resolution

Import resolution is captured by a judgment:

    (Δ, here) × Γ₀ ⊢ e₀ ⇒ e₁ ⊢ Γ₁

You can find the details of this judgment in the following separate document:

* [Import resolution semantics](./imports.md)
